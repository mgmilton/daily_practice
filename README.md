# Idea

What if we practiced data structures, algorithms, code katas, etc. in
one place and then gave each other code review and collaborated on
solutions?

# Ideas for problems to solve

- Big [Project List](./project-list.md) (Lots of random ideas)
- Project Euler
- [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)
- Cracking The Coding Interview

# How to Contribute

* Solve a problem
  * Create a branch (e.g. project-euler-19)
  * Create a file for the problem you intend to solve
    * all code should go in the `solutions` folder.
    * e.g. project Euler problem 19 goes in `pumping-iron/solutions/project-euler/19.rb`
  * Get as far as possible
  * Create a pull request
  * ...
  * profit!

* Request a solution
  * open a Github Issue with a description of the problem
  * ...
  * profit!
